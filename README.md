# NewsReader
A simple NewsApi viewer written in Qt Quick

# What it Is
Small Qt Quick demo app. Loads a list of news items from NewsApi.org and provides a UI to navigate between them.

The user can then click on a story and QtWebEngine will render it.

# Getting Started
For this application to work, you'll have to create an API key from newsapi.org. Create an environment variable called 'NEWS_API_KEY' and set your api key as its value.
